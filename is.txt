MUON-III instructions

Oh god charlie here we go.

D: data
X: unused
, another seperate data word stored in the next location in memory

(where there is an E in front of the mnmonic its an extend
where it reads onto the next word to get a full word of data, rather than using the 16
 bits left with the other 8 taken by the opcode)

	------
JMP	01DDDD			Jumps to the address
MOV	02DDDD,DDDDDD		Moves the data from the first address to the address in the second word.
EJMP	03XXXX,DDDDDD
EMOV    04XXXX,DDDDDD,DDDDDD
CPSW 	05DDDD,DDDDDD		compares the PSW with the data in the first word (format to be decided) and if true, branches to the second adddress
IADD	06DDDD,DDDDDD,DDDDDD	Loads from the first word into the A register, Second to the B, third is where the result is stored.
INA	07DDDD			increments A (uses the data as the location for the scratchpad, can be left to zero)
INB	08DDDD			Ditto above but on the B register
